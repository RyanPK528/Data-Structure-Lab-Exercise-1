# Animal Class Code

This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through an Animal class and its subclass Lion. The program showcases concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Overview
- **Animal.java**: Defines the Animal class, which encapsulates the properties and behaviors common to all animals. It includes a constructor, getters, setters, and a method for making a sound.
- **Lion.java**: Extends the Animal class to create a specialized Lion class. It demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism by overriding the makeSound method.
- **Main.java**: Serves as the driver class to instantiate objects of the Animal and Lion classes and demonstrate their functionality.

## OOP Principles
1. Inheritance: The Lion class inherits properties and behaviors from the Animal class, promoting code reuse.
2. Encapsulation: The fields in the Animal class (name and age) are encapsulated, accessible only through getter and setter methods, ensuring data integrity.
3. Polymorphism: The makeSound method is overridden in the Lion class, allowing for different behaviors in subclasses while using the same method signature.
4. Abstraction: The Animal class provides an abstract method makeSound, allowing subclasses to implement it according to their specific behavior.

## Usage

To run the program, compile all Java files in the repository and execute the Main class.
